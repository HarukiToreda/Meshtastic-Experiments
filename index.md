# Haruki's Meshtastic Experiments

Welcome to my personal Meshtastic experiments. Here, I share my own measurements, values, and various comparisons to help others interested in Meshtastic. Feel free to explore the different sections through the navigation buttons below.

## Detailed Descriptions

**Battery Runtime Tests:**  
I conducted various tests with different devices and batteries to determine the actual runtime. This helps in better planning how long a node will remain powered on when using a battery.

**ADC Calculator:**  
The ADC Calculator on the Meshtastic website is often inaccurate as it calculates based on percentage. This calculator, however, uses the voltage measured by the node for more precise results.

**LoRa Boards Comparison Table:**  
This extensive table compares all development boards with built-in LoRa, allowing you to see and plan out the features available for better planning.

**LoRa Boards Power Measurements:**  
I personally tested and measured the power consumption of each node I own to provide real values based on the tested firmware.

**Additional Hardware:**  
This is a list of all additional hardware currently supported by Meshtastic.
