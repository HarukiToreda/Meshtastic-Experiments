# Haruki's Meshtastic Experiments

Welcome to my personal Meshtastic experiments. Here, I share my own measurements, values, and various comparisons to help others interested in Meshtastic. Feel free to explore the different sections through the navigation links below.

## Navigation and Descriptions

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="/Meshtastic-Experiments/Battery-Runtime-Tests">Battery Runtime Tests</a></td>
      <td>I conducted various tests with different devices and batteries to determine the actual runtime. This helps in better planning how long a node will remain powered on when using a battery.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="/Meshtastic-Experiments/ADC-Calculator">ADC Calculator</a></td>
      <td>The ADC Calculator on the Meshtastic website is often inaccurate as it calculates based on percentage. This calculator, however, uses the voltage measured by the node for more precise results.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="/Meshtastic-Experiments/LoRa-Boards-Comparison-Table">LoRa Boards Comparison Table</a></td>
      <td>This extensive table compares all development boards with built-in LoRa, allowing you to see and plan out the features available for better planning.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="/Meshtastic-Experiments/LoRa-Boards-Power-Measurements">LoRa Boards Power Measurements</a></td>
      <td>I personally tested and measured the power consumption of each node I own to provide real values based on the tested firmware.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="/Meshtastic-Experiments/Additional-Hardware">Additional Hardware</a></td>
      <td>This is a list of all additional hardware currently supported by Meshtastic.</td>
