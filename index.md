# Haruki's Meshtastic Experiments

Welcome to my personal Meshtastic experiments. Here, I share my own measurements, values, and various comparisons to help others interested in Meshtastic. Feel free to explore the different sections through the navigation buttons below.

## Navigation and Descriptions

      <td><a href="/Meshtastic-Experiments/Battery-Runtime-Tests" class="button">Battery Runtime Tests</a></td>
      <td>I conducted various tests with different devices and batteries to determine the actual runtime. This helps in better planning how long a node will remain powered on when using a battery.</td>

      <td><a href="/Meshtastic-Experiments/ADC-Calculator" class="button">ADC Calculator</a></td>
      <td>The ADC Calculator on the Meshtastic website is often inaccurate as it calculates based on percentage. This calculator, however, uses the voltage measured by the node for more precise results.</td>
