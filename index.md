# Haruki's Meshtastic Experiments

Welcome to my personal Meshtastic experiments. Here, I share my own measurements, values, and various comparisons to help others interested in Meshtastic. Feel free to explore the different sections through the navigation buttons below.

## Navigation and Descriptions

<div style="margin: 20px 0;">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/Meshtastic-Experiments/Battery-Runtime-Tests" class="button">Battery Runtime Tests</a> - I conducted various tests with different devices and batteries to determine the actual runtime. This helps in better planning how long a node will remain powered on when using a battery.</li>
    <li><a href="/Meshtastic-Experiments/ADC-Calculator" class="button">ADC Calculator</a> - The ADC Calculator on the Meshtastic website is often inaccurate as it calculates based on percentage. This calculator, however, uses the voltage measured by the node for more precise results.</li>
    <li><a href="/Meshtastic-Experiments/LoRa-Boards-Comparison-Table" class="button">LoRa Boards Comparison Table</a> - This extensive table compares all development boards with built-in LoRa, allowing you to see and plan out the features available for better planning.</li>
    <li><a href="/Meshtastic-Experiments/LoRa-Boards-Power-Measurements" class="button">LoRa Boards Power Measurements</a> - I personally tested and measured the power consumption of each node I own to provide real values based on the tested firmware.</li>
    <li><a href="/Meshtastic-Experiments/Additional-Hardware" class="button">Additional Hardware</a> - This is a list of all additional hardware currently supported by Meshtastic.</li>
  </ul>
