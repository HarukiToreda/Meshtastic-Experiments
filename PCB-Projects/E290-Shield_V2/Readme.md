# E290 Shield V2

The E290 Shield V2 is an add-on board designed for the Heltec Vision Master E290. This shield provides a convenient and modular solution for integrating additional functionalities such as GPS, a buzzer, and a vibration motor. It also exposes pins for easy soldering of additional components, making it highly versatile for various projects.

## Key Features

- **GPS Control**: The GPS module is controlled via a MOSFET, allowing for power-saving and easy toggling through firmware.
- **Buzzer Control**: A transistor protects the board's GPIO pins while ensuring the buzzer operates at a high volume.
- **Vibration Motor Control**: Similar to the buzzer, the vibration motor is controlled by a transistor, safeguarding the GPIO pins and providing strong feedback.
- **Battery Compatibility**: The shield is designed to accommodate a 3000mAh battery, which can be sandwiched between the shield and the main board.
- **Expandability**: Exposed pins allow for the addition of custom components, enhancing the shield's functionality.
